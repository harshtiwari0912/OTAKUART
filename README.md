# OTAKUART
This project is a dynamic and engaging anime poster e-commerce website designed for anime enthusiasts. Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely using bcrypt for password encryption and JWT for authentication. The platform allows users to customize anime posters—selecting sizes, styles, and characters—bringing their favorite anime scenes to life. Admins have exclusive access to create and manage new poster products. Users can browse through an appealing catalog, use the “Add to Cart” feature, and instantly see the calculated total cost along with itemized descriptions in their cart. The site uses Express.js for server-side handling, Mongoose for MongoDB interactions, and Multer for image uploads. With session management via express-session and cookie-parser, and user feedback powered by connect-flash, the application ensures a smooth, personalized experience. Styled with EJS templating, the platform offers a modern, interactive interface that brings anime fandom and creativity together in one seamless shopping experience.
